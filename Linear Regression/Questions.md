#### Linear Regression  
>>>> Predicting the value of Y(numerical) from X(numerical or categorical).  

Q . How to Decide Best fit line  
A. Least Squares. Minimize sum of squared errors  

#### Linear Regression Assumptions  
Link: http://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/ols-linear-regression-assumptions/  

Assumption 1: The regression model is linear in the coefficients and the error term. 

Assumption 2: The error term has the population mean of zero.  
              >> Error term Accounts for the variation in Y not explained by X.  
              
Assumption 3: All independent variables are uncorrelated with the error term.  

Assumption 4: Observations of the error term are uncorrelated with each other.(no autocorrelation)  

Assumption 5: The error term has constant variance(no heteroescdasticity). Residuals vs fitted value  

Note: If condition 4 and 5 exists then error tehrm is IID(Independent and Identically Distributed)  

Assumption 6: No independent variable is perfect linear function of other explanatory variables.(No Multicollinearity)  

Assumption 7: The error term is normally distributed(optional)
