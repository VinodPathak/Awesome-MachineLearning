#### Association Rule Mining/Market Basket Analysis  

1. Suitable for non numeric categorical data.  
2. Simple counting required.  
3. Observe Frequenctly occurring patterns, correlations and associations.

    4.1. an antecedent(if) - Found in data  
    4.2. a consequent(then) - Found in combination with antecedent  
5. Three parameters for observing important relationships/controlling the number of rules  
    5.1. Support - how frequently itemset appears in the dataset
    5.2. Confidence  - how often rule is found to be true
    5.3. Lift  - 
6. Applications  
   6.1. Market Basket Analysis:- Adjust store layout and product catalogue.  
   6.2. Medical Diagnosis:- Defining Relationships between new signs and corresponding diseases.  
   6.3. Census Data
