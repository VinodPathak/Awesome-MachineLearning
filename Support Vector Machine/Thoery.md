* Hyperplane which maximizes the margin between classes.  

* Support Vectors are the data points closest to the hyperplane and influences the osition and orientation of the hyperplane.  

* The Loss function that helps to maximize the margin is hinge loss.  

*

* Hyperparameter C  
    - C Small, Less Missclassification errors.  
    - C Large, High Missclassification errors.  
    
* Kernel Trick - Transforms data
    - Radial Basis  
    - Polynomial  
    - Linear
